Description: Guacamole proxy daemon (core library headers)
 The Guacamole proxy daemon, guacd, translates between remote desktop
 protocols (like VNC) and the Guacamole protocol using protocol plugins.
 Once a user is authenticated with the Guacamole web application, a tunnel
 is established through the web application to guacd, allowing the JavaScript
 client to communicate to an arbitrary remote desktop server through guacd.
 .
 This package contains development headers for the core library.

Description: HTML5 web application for accessing remote desktops (proxy daemon)
 Guacamole is an HTML5 web application that provides access to a desktop
 environment using remote desktop protocols. A centralized server acts as a
 tunnel and proxy, allowing access to multiple desktops through a web browser.
 No plugins are needed: the client requires nothing more than a web browser
 supporting HTML5 and AJAX.
