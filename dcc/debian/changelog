dcc (1.2.74-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Make dcc-common recommend `dcc-client | dcc-server | dcc-milter'

    before the latter.  Closes: #304237, #365893, #387198.
    (`chown dcc.dcc' was quietly fixed in 1.2.74-3.)

dcc (1.2.62-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Changes form Upstream regarding Linux:
    + Fix file descriptor leak in getifaddrs() replacement.
    + Extended format to allow authenticated clients to be delayed
      as `dccd -U` delays anonymous clients in /var/lib/dcc/ids
    + Possibility to limit the size of the database window.
    + Fixed broken `dccd -G0`.
    + Track changes in network interfaces on most modern flavors of UNIX.
    + Fix two MIME decoding bugs.
    + Treat '>' as a blank instead of punctuation for FUZ2 checksums.
    + Don't re-use va_list in stdargs functions to work around a
      characteristic of gcc for AMD 64 bit systems.  gcc 64-bit stdargs
      reportedly passes va_list by reference instead of by value.
  * Dan Weber is no longer maintainer.
  * My own patches reside now in debian/patches rather than in diff.gz
  * Added symlink from /etc/default/dcc-server to /var/lib/dcc/dcc_conf

    them. (closes: #276259)
  * Package should be in better state now. (closes:#278048)
